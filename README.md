# My Power BI Portfolio

Hi!  

This is the space where I keep Power BI projects.  
It's my portfolio and I'd like to share with you guys.  
Let me know if I helped you somehow or if you have any question.  
  
Thank you!

## Uber Travels Dashboard

This is a dashboard that I made using Power BI. It's part of a previous project that I did with SQL and PowerQuery (both are uploaded here, you can check on my other repositories), to manipulate my personal Uber data. With this report, I can visualise quick information about my trips, costs and rates on one page.

## Cross-selling Dashboard

For this one, I used a dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). Based on e-commerce sales data, I created a dashboard to visualise some information about cross-selling revenue and how much of it is part of the total revenue. The user can filter all the visuals by year, month and product category.
